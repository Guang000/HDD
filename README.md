## ðŸŽ¯ Key Contributions

- Hyperbolic Geometry for Dataset Distillation
Introduces the first dataset distillation framework in hyperbolic space, enabling natural modeling of hierarchical data structures.

- Centroid Alignment via Geodesic Distance
Minimizes the Lorentzian hyperbolic distance between FrÃ©chet means of real and synthetic datasets, ensuring semantic and geometric consistency.

- Hierarchical Sample Weighting
Derives analytic weighting that prioritizes prototype-like (root-level) samples while attenuating noisy, peripheral ones.

- Efficient Hierarchical Pruning
Demonstrates that only 20% of the original data is sufficient to maintain comparable accuracy, highlighting hyperbolic redundancy reduction.

- Broad Compatibility & Superior Results
Integrates smoothly with DM and IDM, yielding consistent gains in classification accuracy and training stability across diverse datasets.
