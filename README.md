<!-- ## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Dataset Distillation aims to synthesize a compact dataset that retains the performance of the original large-scale data.
However, conventional Euclidean-based methods overlook the hierarchical and geometric nature of real-world data, treating all samples as independent points.

HDD (Hyperbolic Dataset Distillation) introduces Lorentz hyperbolic space to explicitly model these hierarchical structures.
By aligning the FrÃ©chet means (centroids) of real and synthetic datasets via geodesic distance minimization, HDD captures both global semantics and prototype-level representations, enhancing information fidelity while reducing noise.

This geometric formulation enables hierarchical sample weighting and efficient pruningâ€”retaining as little as 20% of the original data without significant performance degradation.

HDD integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art distribution matching methods (DM, IDM, Dance), consistently improving accuracy, stability, and cross-architecture generalization across benchmarks such as Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and TinyImageNet. -->

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Contributions

- Hyperbolic Geometry for Dataset Distillation
Introduces the first dataset distillation framework in hyperbolic space, enabling natural modeling of hierarchical data structures.

- Centroid Alignment via Geodesic Distance
Minimizes the Lorentzian hyperbolic distance between FrÃ©chet means of real and synthetic datasets, ensuring semantic and geometric consistency.

- Hierarchical Sample Weighting
Derives analytic weighting that prioritizes prototype-like (root-level) samples while attenuating noisy, peripheral ones.

- Efficient Hierarchical Pruning
Demonstrates that only 20% of the original data is sufficient to maintain comparable accuracy, highlighting hyperbolic redundancy reduction.

- Broad Compatibility & Superior Results
Integrates smoothly with DM, IDM, and Dance, yielding consistent gains in classification accuracy and training stability across diverse datasets.
